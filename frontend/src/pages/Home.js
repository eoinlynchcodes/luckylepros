            The Leprechaun is part of Irish mythology and folklore also known as
            ?wee folk?or the ?little people?. Standing 2-3 feet tall,
            leprechauns are a mischievous character. Tales of these small
            creatures first emerged in the 8thcentury, when legends about tiny
            dwellers began circulating among the Celts. They are believed to be
            a part of another piece of famous folklore, as they are
            traditionally known to be members of the fairy family.

            If you're lucky enough to own a Lepro, you?re owning a rare piece of
            art and gaining membership access to a collaborative community where
            your voice impacts the future direction of the community. We want to
            continue to tell the many tales of leprechauns throughout history,
            their current travels onto the blockchain and their future
            adventures. To do this, we want to collaborate with Lepro holders
            and develop the LuckyLepros story further. Funds from the Community
            Rainbow Gold Pot Project will serve as the initial start-up capital
            required to kick start these projects and begin the new era of
            Lepros.
